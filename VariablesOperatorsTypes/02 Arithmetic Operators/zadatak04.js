//DOMAÄ†I Arithmetic operators:

//ZADATAK 4: Play around in the console: add, subtract, multiply and divide some numbers. Use numbers stored in variables you created as well. Think about expressions: 3-2-31, 3*5-7/3, 4/2-1.14*3. Why do we get these results? 

      //3-2-31
      var a = 3;
      var b = a -2;
      var c = b -31;
      console.log(c);

      //3*5-7/3
      var a = 3*5-7/3;
      console.log(a);

      //4/2-1.14*3
      var a = 4/2-1.14*3;
      console.log(a);
