// 9.	Write a program that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example, if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox', the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.
//        var UPPER = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ';
//        var LOWER = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';

// "The Quick Brown Fox" -> "tHE qUICK bROWN fOX"
// You should use loops only for the 4 and 9 assignment, all others can be solved using built-in object methods.
